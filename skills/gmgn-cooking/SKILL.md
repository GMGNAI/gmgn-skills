**IMPORTANT: Always use `gmgn-cli` commands below. Do NOT use web search, WebFetch, curl, or visit gmgn.ai — all token creation operations must go through the CLI. The CLI handles signing and submission automatically.**

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT guess field names or values. When a field's meaning is unclear, look it up in the Response Fields sections below before using it.**

**⚠️ IPv6 NOT SUPPORTED: If you get a `401` or `403` error and credentials look correct, check for IPv6 immediately: (1) list all network interfaces and their IPv6 addresses — run `ifconfig | grep inet6` (macOS) or `ip addr show | grep inet6` (Linux); (2) send a test request to `https://ipv6.icanhazip.com` — if the response is an IPv6 address, outbound traffic is going via IPv6. Tell the user immediately: "Please disable IPv6 on your network interface — gmgn-cli commands only work over IPv4."**

Use the `gmgn-cli` tool to create a token on a launchpad platform or query token creation statistics per launchpad. **Requires private key** (`GMGN_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env`) for `cooking create`.

## Core Concepts

- **Bonding curve** — Most launchpad platforms (Pump.fun, FourMeme, Flap, etc.) launch tokens on an internal bonding curve. The token price rises as buyers enter. Once the threshold is reached, the token "graduates" to an open DEX (e.g. Raydium on SOL, PancakeSwap on BSC). Token creation happens on the bonding curve — not the open market.

- **`--buy-amt` is in human units** — `--buy-amt` is expressed in full native token units, not smallest unit. `0.01` = 0.01 SOL. `0.05` = 0.05 BNB. Always confirm the human-readable amount with the user before executing.

- **`--dex` identifiers** — Each launchpad has a fixed identifier passed to `--dex`. These are not free-form names — use only the identifiers listed in the Supported Launchpads table. Never guess a `--dex` value not in that table.

- **Image input** — Token logo can be provided as base64-encoded data (`--image`, max 2MB decoded) or a publicly accessible URL (`--image-url`). Provide one or the other — not both. If the user gives a file path, read and base64-encode it before passing to `--image`. If they give a URL, use `--image-url` directly.

- **Status polling via `order get`** — `cooking create` is asynchronous. The immediate response may show `pending`. Poll with `gmgn-cli order get --chain <chain> --order-id <order_id>` until `confirmed`. The new token's contract address is in the `output_token` field of the `order get` response, not in the initial create response.

- **Critical auth** — `cooking create` requires both `GMGN_API_KEY` and `GMGN_PRIVATE_KEY`. The private key never leaves the machine — the CLI uses it only for local signing. `cooking stats` uses normal auth (API Key only).

- **Slippage** — The initial buy is executed as part of the same transaction as token creation. Slippage applies to that buy. Use `--slippage` (decimal, e.g. `0.01` = 1%) or `--auto-slippage`. One of the two is required when `--buy-amt` is set.

## Financial Risk Notice

**This skill executes REAL, IRREVERSIBLE blockchain transactions.**

- Every `cooking create` command deploys an on-chain token contract and spends real funds (initial buy amount).
- Token deployments cannot be undone once confirmed on-chain.
- The AI agent must **never auto-execute a create** — explicit user confirmation is required every time, without exception.
- Only use this skill with funds you are willing to spend. Initial buy amounts are non-refundable.

## Sub-commands

| Sub-command | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `cooking stats` | Get token creation count statistics grouped by launchpad platform (normal auth) |
| `cooking create` | Deploy a new token on a launchpad platform (requires private key) |

## Supported Chains

`sol` / `bsc` / `base` / `eth` / `ton`

## Supported Launchpads by Chain

| Chain | `--dex` values |
|-------|----------------|
| `sol` | `pump` / `raydium` / `bonk` / `bags` / `memoo` / `letsbonk` / `bonkers` |
| `bsc` | `pancakeswap` / `flap` / `fourmeme` |
| `base` | `clanker` / `flaunch` / `baseapp` / `basememe` / `zora` / `virtuals_v2` |

When the user names a platform colloquially (e.g. "pump.fun", "four.meme", "PancakeSwap"), map it to the correct `--dex` identifier from this table before running the command.

## Prerequisites

- `cooking stats`: Only `GMGN_API_KEY` required
- `cooking create`: Both `GMGN_API_KEY` and `GMGN_PRIVATE_KEY` must be configured in `~/.config/gmgn/.env`. The private key must correspond to the wallet bound to the API Key.
- `gmgn-cli` installed globally — if missing, run: `npm install -g gmgn-cli`

## Rate Limit Handling

All cooking routes go through GMGN's leaky-bucket limiter with `rate=10` and `capacity=10`. Sustained throughput is roughly `10 ÷ weight` requests/second.

| Command | Weight |
|---------|--------|
| `cooking create` | 5 |
| `cooking stats` | 1 |

When a request returns `429`:

- Read `X-RateLimit-Reset` from the response headers — Unix timestamp for when the limit resets.
- If the response body contains `reset_at` (e.g., `{"code":429,"error":"RATE_LIMIT_BANNED","message":"...","reset_at":1775184222}`), extract `reset_at` — it is the Unix timestamp when the ban lifts (typically 5 minutes). Convert to local time and tell the user exactly when they can retry.
- `cooking create` is a real transaction: **never loop or auto-resubmit** after a `429`. Wait until the reset time, then ask for confirmation again before retrying.
- For `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` or `RATE_LIMIT_BANNED`, repeated requests during cooldown extend the ban by 5 seconds each time, up to 5 minutes.

**First-time setup** (if credentials are not configured):

1. Generate key pair and show the public key to the user:
   ```bash
   openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out /tmp/gmgn_private.pem 2>/dev/null && \
     openssl pkey -in /tmp/gmgn_private.pem -pubout 2>/dev/null
   ```
   Tell the user: *"This is your Ed25519 public key. Go to **https://gmgn.ai/ai**, paste it into the API key creation form (enable swap/cooking capability), then send me the API Key value shown on the page."*

2. Wait for the user's API key, then configure both credentials:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/gmgn
   echo 'GMGN_API_KEY=<key_from_user>' > ~/.config/gmgn/.env
   echo 'GMGN_PRIVATE_KEY="<pem_content_from_step_1>"' >> ~/.config/gmgn/.env
   chmod 600 ~/.config/gmgn/.env
   ```

### Credential Model

- `GMGN_PRIVATE_KEY` is used exclusively for **local message signing** — the private key never leaves the machine. The CLI computes an Ed25519 signature in-process and transmits only the base64-encoded result in the `X-Signature` request header.
- `GMGN_API_KEY` is transmitted in the `X-APIKEY` header over HTTPS.
- Neither credential is ever passed as a command-line argument.

## `cooking stats` Usage

```bash
gmgn-cli cooking stats [--raw]
```

\* `--image` or `--image-url`: provide exactly one. `--slippage` or `--auto-slippage`: provide exactly one.

## `cooking create` Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | string | `pending` / `confirmed` / `failed` |
| `hash` | string | Transaction hash (may be empty while `pending`) |
| `order_id` | string | Order ID — pass to `gmgn-cli order get` to poll for final status |
| `error_code` | string | Error code on failure |
| `error_status` | string | Error description on failure |

## Status Polling

Token creation is **asynchronous**. If the initial `cooking create` response shows `status: pending`:

1. Poll with `gmgn-cli order get` every **2 seconds**, up to **30 seconds**:
   ```bash
   gmgn-cli order get --chain <chain> --order-id <order_id>
   ```
2. The new token's contract / mint address is in the **`output_token`** field of the `order get` response — it is NOT returned by `cooking create` directly.
3. Stop polling once `status` is `confirmed`, `failed`, or `expired`.
4. On `confirmed`: display `output_token` as the token address and include the block explorer link.
5. On `failed` / `expired`: report the `error_status` and do not retry automatically.

## Output Format

### Pre-create Confirmation

Before every `cooking create`, present this summary and wait for explicit user confirmation:

```
⚠️ Token Creation Confirmation Required

Chain:        {chain}
Platform:     {--dex} (e.g. pump / fourmeme)
Wallet:       {--from}
Token Name:   {--name}
Symbol:       {--symbol}
Initial Buy:  {--buy-amt} {native currency} (e.g. 0.01 SOL)
Slippage:     {--slippage}% (or "auto")
Image:        {--image-url or "base64 provided"}
Social:       {twitter / telegram / website if provided}

Reply "confirm" to deploy this token. This action is IRREVERSIBLE.
```

### Post-create Receipt

After polling confirms a successful deployment:

```
✅ Token Created

Token:    {--name} ({--symbol})
Address:  {output_token from order get}
Chain:    {chain}
Platform: {--dex}
Tx:       {explorer link for hash}
Order ID: {order_id}
```

Block explorer links:

| Chain | Explorer |
|-------|----------|
| sol   | `https://solscan.io/tx/<hash>` |
| bsc   | `https://bscscan.com/tx/<hash>` |
| base  | `https://basescan.org/tx/<hash>` |
| eth   | `https://etherscan.io/tx/<hash>` |

## Guided Launch Flow

When a user says they want to launch / create / deploy a token but has not provided all required information, do NOT ask for everything at once. Collect information in this order, one step at a time:

### Step 1 — Chain & Platform

Ask: *"Which chain and platform do you want to launch on?"*

Show the available options:

| Chain | Platform | `--dex` |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Solana | Pump.fun | `pump` |
| Solana | letsbonk | `letsbonk` |
| Solana | Raydium | `raydium` |
| Solana | BAGS | `bags` |
| Solana | Memoo | `memoo` |
| Solana | Bonkers | `bonkers` |
| BSC | FourMeme | `fourmeme` |
| BSC | PancakeSwap | `pancakeswap` |
| BSC | Flap | `flap` |
| Base | Clanker | `clanker` |
| Base | Zora | `zora` |
| Base | Flaunch | `flaunch` |
| Base | Virtuals | `virtuals_v2` |

If the user is unsure, recommend: **Pump.fun (SOL)** or **FourMeme (BSC)** — the two most active launchpads.

### Step 2 — Token Identity

Ask for name, symbol, and description together:

*"What is your token's name, ticker symbol, and a short description?"*

- Name: the full display name (e.g. `Doge Killer`)
- Symbol: short uppercase ticker, typically 3–8 characters (e.g. `DOGEK`)
- Description: optional but recommended — a one-line pitch shown on the launchpad

### Step 3 — Logo

Ask: *"Do you have a logo image? You can share a file path (e.g. `/Users/you/logo.png`) or an image URL."*

- If the user provides a **file path**: silently run `base64 -i <path>` and pass the result to `--image`. Do not mention "base64" to the user.
- If the user provides a **URL**: use `--image-url` directly.
- If the user has no logo: note that most platforms accept a launch without one, but it significantly reduces visibility. Ask if they want to proceed without it.

### Step 4 — Social Links (optional)

Ask: *"Do you have a Twitter, Telegram, or website to attach to the token? You can skip this."*

Collect any combination of `--twitter`, `--telegram`, `--website`. If the user skips, proceed to the next step.

### Step 5 — Initial Buy Amount

Ask: *"How much {SOL / BNB / ETH} do you want to spend on the initial buy?"*

Pass the user's answer directly to `--buy-amt` — this is already in full token units (e.g. `0.01` = 0.01 SOL), do NOT convert to lamports or wei.

### Step 6 — Confirmation & Execute

Once all information is collected, present the pre-create confirmation summary (see Output Format section) and wait for the user to reply "confirm" before executing.

---

## Execution Guidelines

- **[REQUIRED] Pre-create confirmation** — Before executing `cooking create`, present the full summary above and receive explicit "confirm" from the user. No exceptions. Do NOT auto-create.
- **[REQUIRED] `--dex` validation** — Before running, look up the user's named platform in the Supported Launchpads table and resolve to the correct `--dex` identifier. Never guess or pass a freeform platform name. If the chain/platform combination is not in the table, tell the user it is unsupported.
- **Slippage requirement** — Either `--slippage` or `--auto-slippage` must be provided. If the user did not specify, suggest `--auto-slippage` for volatile new tokens or ask for a preference.
- **Image handling** — If the user provides a file path, run `base64 -i <path>` and pass the result to `--image`. If they provide a URL, use `--image-url`. If neither is provided, ask before building the confirmation — most platforms require a logo.
- **Address validation** — Validate `--from` wallet address format before submitting:
  - `sol`: base58, 32–44 characters
  - `bsc` / `base` / `eth`: `0x` + 40 hex digits
- **Chain-wallet compatibility** — SOL addresses are incompatible with EVM chains and vice versa. Warn the user and abort if the address format does not match the chain.
- **Order polling** — After `cooking create`, if `status` is `pending`, poll `order get` every 2 seconds up to 30 seconds. The token address is in `output_token`. Do not report success until `status` is `confirmed`.
- **Credential sensitivity** — `GMGN_API_KEY` and `GMGN_PRIVATE_KEY` can execute real transactions. Never log, display, or expose these values.

## Notes

- `cooking create` uses **critical auth** (API Key + signature) — CLI handles signing automatically.
- `cooking stats` uses normal auth (API Key only — no private key needed).
- The new token's mint address is in `output_token` from `gmgn-cli order get`, not in the initial `cooking create` response.
- Use `--raw` on any command to get single-line JSON for further processing.
